# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Abraham (Abe) Tishelman-Charny and I am a postdoctoral researcher at Brookhaven National Laboratory, working as a part of the ATLAS collaboration, and I am currently based at BNL on Long Island (USA). I'm passionate about teaching and learning, and currently practice that in the context of high energy physics. I am currently studying the physics of Higgs Boson pair production, and am working on the assembly and testing of the ATLAS strip tracker upgrade (ITk). 

Feel free to e-mail me about anything at: `abraham.tishelman.charny@cern.ch`
